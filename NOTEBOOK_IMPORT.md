# Notebook → saleha-0.1 import

Pulled the useful, not-yet-integrated code out of `Notebook/` into the repo.
`Notebook/` itself is untouched (gitignored research vault).

## Added

| Landed at | From | Lines | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rust/intent-kernel/` | `Notebook/intent-kernel/` | ~4,500 | **Rust agentic core.** intent → plan compiler → capability registry → executor (snapshot/rollback) → hash-chained proof ledger → Ollama LLM client → reflexion/negotiation. Working; ships runtime state in `.ik/`. This is the Rust performance layer saleha's Python side never had. See `docs/v0.3-technical-spec.md`. |
| `rust/meridian-core/` | `Notebook/meridian-core/` | ~2,700 | Rust agent framework — agent runtime, swarm (`swam.rs` 696 ln), LLM bindings, MCP client. Half-built: `swam.rs`, `client.rs`, `bindings.rs` are real; `memory/*`, `workflow/*`, several `llm/*` are empty stubs. |
| `rust/fragments/` | loose `.rs` in Notebook root | ~900 | `runtime.rs` (lock-free ring buffer / IPC), `server.rs`, `sync.rs`, `swarm_demo.rs`. Unattached snippets — mine for the IPC / hot-path patterns. |
| `saleha/sandbox/` | `Notebook/v5_production_system_with_33_specs/02_v5_engine/` | ~420 | `sandbox_jail.py` (POSIX process jail, 128MB cap, anti-fork-bomb), `ast_security_verifier.py` (AST auditor, banned imports), `local_llm_driver.py` (Ollama/vLLM + JSON mode), `v5_production_core.py` (evaluator-optimizer self-heal loop + SQLite). **Real sandbox** — `saleha/core/` only has sandbox theater. |
| `saleha/specs/agent_specs/` | v5 `01_agent_specs/` | 34 files | Agent role definitions (YAML frontmatter): ai_engineer, cloud_architect, firmware_engineer, ml_engineer, qa_engineer, sre, security_engineer, … Reference for `saleha/agents/`. |
| `saleha/experimental/aionx/extensions_v10.py` | `Notebook/aionx-v10-backend_1/` | ~800 | Claude-API agent extensions: self-consistency voting, Critic-A/B/Judge debate, multi-lang codegen, GitHub PR gen, cron missions, plugin system, WS token streaming, cost routing. Uses `anthropic` SDK (cloud, not local). |
| `saleha/server/dashboard_reference.jsx` | `Notebook/saleha_dashboard.jsx` | ~460 | React dashboard — reference for `saleha/server/web_server.py`'s UI. |
| `docs/notes/hyperbolic_geometry.txt` | `Notebook/geometry.txt` | ~600 | Hyperbolic / Poincaré math notes — background for `saleha/core/hyperbolic_engine.py`. |
| `docs/notes/mhd_engine_reference.cpp` | Notebook root | ~350 | C++ magnetohydrodynamics solver (Dedner GLM). Out of scope for the coding agent — parked. |
| `docs/notes/*.txt` | `Architecture Vision.txt`, `MUKTI Sovereign AI Summary.txt`, `Mukti Agents SDK Implementation.txt` | — | Design notes / ASCII architecture diagrams. Reference only. |
| `saleha/specs/project_zip_generator.py`, `saleha/specs/README.md` | v5 root | — | v5 skeleton generator + its README. |

## NOT copied (deliberately)

- `Notebook/**/target/`, `*.exe`, `*.pdb`, `*.rlib`, `*.rmeta` — Rust build artifacts (`cargo build` regenerates).
- The 40 PDF decks + 24 chat exports — these are the *source* of the vision; already distilled into `saleha/core/`. Stay in `Notebook/`.
- `v5_production_system/files.zip`, `LM Studio vs Ollama.docx` — archives/notes.

## Second pass — from `nexus-universe/` (the re-assembled chat-export code)

`nexus-universe/` was built by pattern-matching every code block out of the same
chat exports. Most of it duplicates the already-cleaned `saleha/core/` — that was
**skipped**. Only the genuinely-new, not-in-saleha-0.1 areas were pulled:

| Landed at | From | Files | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `contracts/` | `nexus-universe/contracts/` | 37 | **On-chain economy layer** — Solidity (Bridge, AgentReputation, EscrowMarketplace, CompoundStaking, VAATracker) + CosmWasm Rust (mukti-dao, mkt-token, mkt-bridge, fee-abstraction). saleha-0.1 had zero chain code. |
| `rust/crates/` | `agentstack/crates/` + `crates/` | 90 | **Sovereign / L1 / crypto Rust crates** — zkml_prover, fhe_machine, verkle_tree, pqc_identity, tee_core/enclave_runtime, snn_core, agent-consensus (pbft/hotstuff/bls_threshold), nexus-safety (constitutional_drift, memory_interp_probe), nexus-core dispatch, secure-node. |
| `rust/nexus-l1/` `rust/nexus-l1-core/` `rust/nexus_core/` | same | 13 | L1 chain node — blockchain, consensus (povc), state, api. |
| `rust/nexus-zkvm/` `rust/zkvm-guest/` `rust/nexus-executor/` | same | 5 | zkVM host/guest + executor. |
| `rust/cpp-native/` | `agentstack/cpp/` + `cpp/` | 22 | C++ — pbft.cpp, federated_learning.cpp, gnn/emergence_detector, snn_engine, lockfree_ring_buffer, arena_allocator, ebpf_agent. |
| `rust/specs-tla/` | `misc-title/tla/` | 5 | **TLA+ formal specs** — NexusAgenticV7, HotStuffExtension, HardwareAsync (+ .cfg). |
| `saleha/experimental/jarvis/` | `nexus-universe/jarvis/` | 16 | **Voice / perception arm skeleton** — whisper STT, duplex audio, speculative decoder, paged KV cache, world model, self-awareness, common-sense engines. |
| `docs/manifestos/` | `agent_manifestos/` | 4 | `soul.md`, `harness.md`, `threat_model.md`, `agentskills.md` — agent identity/philosophy. |
| `docs/notes/model-lab/` | `nexus-universe/model-lab/` | 7 | `trust_kernel.py`, `prooftsilicon_trust.py` + HTMX dashboard templates. |
| `deploy/k8s/` | `nexus-universe/k8s/` | 96 | argo, argocd, rollout, chaos, multi-region, slo, velero, monitoring manifests. |
| `deploy/infra/` | `nexus-universe/infra/` | 48 | terraform (modules), ansible (roles), k8s, protos. |
| `deploy/monitoring/` `deploy/ci-workflows-ref/` | same | 21 | grafana dashboards, prometheus; 17 GitHub Actions workflows (reference). |

**Skipped from `nexus-universe/`** (deliberately, per "jo pehle se hai vo nhi"):

- `mukti/` `saleha/` `nexus-omni/` `nexus-agentic/` `nexus-advanced/` Python — ~1,000 pattern-matched .py files that duplicate the clean `saleha/core/` (205 modules) the user already built.
- `apps/` `packages/` `scripts/` `tests/` `docs/` — saleha-0.1 has real ones.
- `_loose/` (2,193) `_extracted/` (6,544) `misc-*/` — raw dump / fragments. Kept in `nexus-universe/` as an archive; delete when confident.

`nexus-universe/` can now be treated as a disposable staging repo.

## Loose ends to fix

- `rust/intent-kernel/cargo.toml` → rename to `Cargo.toml` (Rust is case-sensitive here).
- `rust/meridian-core/src/memory/mod.rs.rs` → `mod.rs` (double extension).
- `rust/meridian-core/` has empty stub files — fill or delete before `cargo build`.
- `saleha/specs/agent_specs/ai_engineer - Copy.md` → dedupe.
- `rust/` has no workspace `Cargo.toml` tying the two crates together — add one if you want a single `cargo build`.
